# Kite Simulation System

A C++ library for simulating kite flight dynamics, aerodynamics, and control systems.

## Overview

This library implements a comprehensive 6-DOF (six degrees of freedom) kite simulation system based on rigid body dynamics, aerodynamic modeling, and tether mechanics. The system is designed for research applications, control system development, and flight analysis.

## Features

- 6-DOF rigid body dynamics
- Aerodynamic force and moment calculation
- Tether mechanics modeling
- Wind field simulation
- Control system interfaces
- Real-time simulation capabilities
- Data export and analysis tools

## Build Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.16 or higher
- GoogleTest (automatically downloaded if not found)

## Building

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running Tests

```bash
cd build
ctest
```

## Status

This project is currently under development. The current implementation provides:

- [x] Project structure and build system
- [x] Mathematical type interfaces (pending math library integration)
- [x] Coordinate transformation interfaces
- [ ] Core data structures (in progress)
- [ ] Aerodynamics module
- [ ] Dynamics engine
- [ ] Tether mechanics
- [ ] Integration system
- [ ] Control interfaces

## Math Library Integration

The mathematical types (Vector3, Quaternion, Matrix3x3) are currently defined as interfaces. These will be implemented as wrappers around a chosen math library (e.g., Eigen, GLM) in a future update.
