# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a kite simulation system based on the research paper from TU Delft. The system will model kite dynamics, aerodynamic forces, flight control, and tether mechanics for airborne wind energy systems or recreational kite simulation. The implementation will focus on creating a robust C++ simulation framework that can handle kite flight dynamics, aerodynamic calculations, and real-time simulation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a kite simulation researcher, I want to simulate kite flight dynamics and aerodynamic forces, so that I can analyze kite behavior under different wind conditions and control inputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives wind speed, direction, and kite state inputs THEN the system SHALL calculate aerodynamic forces (lift, drag) and moments acting on the kite
2. WHEN aerodynamic calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL compute kite acceleration and angular acceleration based on force balance
3. WHEN simulation parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL validate kite geometry, mass properties, and environmental conditions
4. WHEN calculations are complete THEN the system SHALL output kite position, velocity, attitude, and aerodynamic coefficients

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a simulation engineer, I want to configure different kite parameters and tether properties, so that I can simulate various kite designs and flight configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN kite configuration is requested THEN the system SHALL accept parameters for kite geometry, mass, inertia, and aerodynamic coefficients
2. WHEN tether configuration is defined THEN the system SHALL accept tether length, mass, drag coefficient, and attachment points
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate parameter consistency and physical constraints
4. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with physically meaningful bounds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a flight dynamics analyst, I want to simulate kite control and stability, so that I can analyze flight envelope, control authority, and stability characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN control inputs are applied THEN the system SHALL simulate kite response to control surface deflections or bridle adjustments
2. WHEN stability analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL calculate trim conditions and linearized dynamics around equilibrium points
3. WHEN flight envelope analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL identify stable flight regions and stall/instability boundaries
4. WHEN control system is integrated THEN the system SHALL support closed-loop control with feedback from kite state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the kite simulation, I want a clean C++ API with real-time capabilities and proper memory management, so that I can incorporate kite dynamics into interactive applications or control systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is used THEN the system SHALL provide RAII-compliant resource management with deterministic performance
2. WHEN real-time simulation is required THEN the system SHALL support fixed time-step integration with configurable step size
3. WHEN the library is integrated THEN the system SHALL provide header-only or compiled library options with minimal dependencies
4. WHEN simulation state is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide thread-safe read access to current kite state and history

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher analyzing kite flight data, I want to export simulation trajectories and performance metrics, so that I can validate results against experimental data and perform post-processing analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trajectory export is requested THEN the system SHALL output time-series data of kite position, velocity, attitude, and forces
2. WHEN simulation results are exported THEN the system SHALL support CSV and binary formats with configurable precision
3. WHEN real-time visualization is needed THEN the system SHALL provide callback interfaces for live data streaming
4. WHEN flight analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL calculate and export derived metrics like flight path efficiency and power generation potential
